# SafariCloudTabReader  
This simple app puts a menu bar item to quickly access all you remote Safari tabs.  
From there you can open them in your default browser.  

A chromium extension is also provided and lets you see your tabs right in your browser instead of using the menu bar item.

Additionally you can request the tabs with HTTP on `localhost:7474/tabs` this would allow you to create an extension for non chrome based browsers for example.

## Contribute  
The UX is still pretty rough but this tool is already usable as is. Any PR to improve the extension or the core app is welcome.

## TODO
- [ ] Launch at login  
- [ ] Improve UX  
- [ ] Release extension on chrome extension store
